Project Scope

Simulated for a mid-size construction firm managing multiple suppliers and core materials (Cement, Gravel, Steel).

Each phase of the procurement lifecycle was analyzed:

âœ… Key Components
1. Purchase Order Analysis

>>Tracked order volumes, lead times, and delays

>>Identified the most frequently ordered materials

>>Flagged suppliers with recurring late deliveries

2. Spend Benchmarking

>>Compared company_spend vs. the average market prices

>>Found cost-saving opportunities (e.g., SUP01â€™s cement pricing)

>>Recommended renegotiation or supplier consolidation

3. Supplier KPI Dashboard

>>KPIs tracked: On-Time %, Delay Days, Spend, Cost per Order

>>Underperforming suppliers are identified using clear thresholds

>>Added risk ratings to guide supplier decisions

4. Bid Evaluation Matrix

>>Compared supplier quotes for Steel

>>Scored across price, lead time, warranty, and documentation

>>Used a weighted matrix to select the optimal bid

5. Forecasting Material Costs

>>Used FORECAST.ETS to project pricing trends for (Cement, Gravel, Steel)

>>Cement remained stable, Steel showed a rising trend

>>Recommendations made to lock contracts or monitor closely

6. SOP Checklist

>>Documented required compliance items for each procurement phase

>>Included folder naming rules and internal file tracking

>>Ensured readiness for audits or internal standardization

ðŸ“Š Tools Used

>>Microsoft Excel (formulas, pivot tables, dashboards)

>>FORECAST.ETS (time-series forecasting)

>>Weighted matrix for bid scoring

>>Conditional formatting and data validation

ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways

>>Supplier performance directly impacts cost and delivery timelines

>>Transparent bid evaluation improves decision accuracy

>>Market benchmarking helps uncover hidden savings

>>Forecasting supports proactive budget planning

>>SOPs reduce compliance risk

ðŸ“ˆ Suggested Next Steps

>>Expand to include more POs and supplier categories

>>Automate parts of the dashboard using Power Query

Build a real-time dashboard in Power BI or Google Data Studio

Use this framework to guide sourcing decisions and quarterly reviews
